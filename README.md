# OpenCV Projects Repository

Welcome to the **OpenCV Projects Repository**! This repository contains a collection of small, easy-to-understand projects that demonstrate key concepts and techniques in OpenCV, the popular computer vision library. Each project focuses on a specific OpenCV feature and provides code examples with explanations.
